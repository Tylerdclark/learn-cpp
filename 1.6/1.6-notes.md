# 1.6 Uninitialized variables and undefined behavior

In C++, most variables do not get initialized to a value. When this happens, the variable is aptly called an **uninitialized variable**. If there was already a value at that memory location, the variable gets that value.

* **Initialization** = The object is given a known value at the point of definition.
* **Assignment** = The object is given a known value beyond the point of definition.
* **Uninitialized** = The object has not been given a known value yet.

Using the value from an uninitialized variable is our first example of **undefined behavior**. Undefined behavior is the result of executing code whose behavior is not well defined by the C++ language.

Using an uninitialized variable is a common mistake for beginners and is hard to debug. Always initialize!

Undefined behavior is the result of executing code whose behavior is not well defined by the language. The result can be almost anything, including something that behaves correctly.
