# 1.4 Variable assignment and initialization

## Variable assignment

After a var has been defined, you can give it a value using the = operator. This process is called **copy assignment**.

``` c++
int width; // defining a var of type integer
width = 5; // copy assignment in the variable width
```

## Copy and direct assignment

instead of using two statements like with assignment, the two can be combined, which is called **initialization**.

``` c++
int width = 5; // copy initialization of value 5 into variable width
```

also **Direct assignment** can be done, using parenthesis.

``` c++
int width( 5 ); // direct initialization of value 5 into variable width
```

## Brace initialization

Because parenthesis based initialization cannot be used for things like object with lists of data, **brace initialization** was created.

``` c++
int width{ 5 }; // direct brace initialization of value 5 into variable width (preferred)
int height = { 6 }; // copy brace initialization of value 6 into variable height
```

Brace initializations have the added benefit of disallowing narrowing covnersions, which means the compiler will not allow variables to be initialized with unauthorized data.

Best practice is to favor brace initialization.

## Initilize your variables

It is best practice to initilize variables upon creation, unless there is a specific reason to do otherwise.

``` c++
int a, b; //  multiple defining
int a = 5, b = 6; // multiple copy initialization
int c( 7 ), d( 8 ); // multiple direct initialization
int e{ 9 }, f{ 10 }; // multiple brace initialization (preferred)
int a, b = 5; // wrong (a is not initialized!)
int a = 5, b = 5; // correct
```
