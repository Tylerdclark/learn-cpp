# 1.4 Variable assignment and initialization

## Variable assignmen

After a var has been defined, you can give it a value using the = operator. This process is called **copy assignment**.

``` c++
int width; // defining a var of type integer
width = 5; // copy assignment in the variable width
```

## Copy and direct assignment

instead of using two statements like with assignment, the two can be combined, which is called **initialization**.

``` c++
int width = 5; // copy initialization of value 5 into variable width
```

also **Direct assignment** can be done, using parenthesis.

``` c++
int width( 5 ); // direct initialization of value 5 into variable width
```

## Brace initialization
