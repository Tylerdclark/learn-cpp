# 2.6 â€” Whitespace and basic formatting

**Whitespace** - Is a term that refers to the characters that are used for formatting.

Typically:

* spaces
* tabs
* newlines

c++ ignores whitespace generally, making it a whitespace - independent language.

One exception where the compiler pays attention to white space is within quotes.

Newlines are not allowed in quotes

Quoted text separated by nothing but whitespace (spaces, tabs, or newlines) will be concatenated:

```c++
std::cout << "Hello "
        "world!"; // prints "Hello world!"
```

**Best practice:** Your lines should be no longer that 80 chars in length.

Well that was a short one. It was, after all, about whitespace.
