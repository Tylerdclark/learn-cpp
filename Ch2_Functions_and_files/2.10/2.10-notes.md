# Introduction to preprocessor

Before compilation, the the code file goes through a phase called **translation**.

In the translation phase, preprocessor directives are executed. They look like:

``` C++
#define BLAH
```

When you #include a file, the preprocessor replaces the #include directive with the contents of the included file.

The #define directive can be used to create a macro. In C++, a **macro** is a rule that defines how input text is converted into replacement output text.

There are two basic types of macros: object-like macros, and function-like macros.

Object-like macros can be defined in one of two ways:

``` C++
#define identifier
#define identifier substitution_text
```
