# 2.2 â€” Function return values

The C++ standard only defines the meaning of 3 status codes:

* 0
* EXIT_SUCCESS
* EXIT_FAILURE

to use the last two, you need to include <cstdlib>

C++ disallows calling the main function directly.

Nested function also not allowed

The main should be declared after the other functions.

It's best to always explicitly specify the return value in non-void returning functions. Failure to do so can result in undefined behavior.

When a return statement is executed, the function returns back to the caller immediately after.

A function can only return a single value.
