# 2.4 — Introduction to local scope

**Local variables** - variables defined inside the function body

``` c++
int add(int x, int y) // function parameters x and y are local variables
{
    int z{ x + y }; // z is a local variable too
 
    return z;
}
```

Local variables are destroyed in the opposite order of creation at the end of the set of curly braces in which it is defined (or for a function parameter, at the end of the function).

an object’s **lifetime** is defined to be the time between its creation and destruction.

An identifier’s **scope** determines where the identifier can be accessed within the source code.

When an identifier can be accessed, it is in scope. When it cannot, it is out of scope. trying to access an identifier when it is out of scope will result in a compilation error.
