# 2.5 — Why functions are useful, and how to use them effectively

## Then Benefits of using functions -

**Organization** - Breaking large code makes for more organized code.

**Reusability** - Functions help you not repeat yourself, which will reward in the long run.

**Testing** - By singling out certain functionality, it is easier to find problem areas.

**Extensibility** - By using functions, changes can be echoed throughout all uses of the function.

**Abstraction** - Can allow functionality without the nitty gritty details of implementation when using other people's code.

Every time you use operator<< or operator>> to do input or output, you’re using a function provided by the standard library

## When to use a function -

* When statements appear more than once in a program

* When code has well-defined sets of inputs and outputs
  
* When a function is too long - can be **refactored** into smaller functions (a function should have one task)
