C++11 also adds two special identifiers: override and final. These have a specific meaning when used in certain contexts but are not reserved.

## Identifier naming rules

The name of a variable is called an identifier

The identifier:

* must not be a keyword
* must be comprised of letters, numbers and the underscore character (no symbols)
* must being with a letter or underscore
* is case-sensitive

## Identifier best practices

Variables should begin with a lowercase letter and if it is one word, the whole thing should be lowercase (like every other programming language it seems)

Functions should also start with lowercase (but this is contentious) and additionally camelCase where every word after is capitalized.

Identifier names that start with a capital letter are typically used for user-defined types (such as structs, classes, and enumerations, all of which we will cover later)

Avoid starting identifiers with an underscore. These names are typically reserved for OS, library, and/or compiler use.

Use descriptive naming!
