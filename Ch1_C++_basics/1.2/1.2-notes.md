# 1.2 — Comments

A **comment** is a programmer-readable note that is inserted directly into the source code of the program. Comments are ignored by the compiler and are for the programmer’s use only.

## Different types of comments

### Single line comments

The // symnbol begins a single line comment and gets ignored by the compiler

``` c++
std:cout << "Hello world!"; // Everything from here to the end of the line is ignored
```

### Multi-line comments

The /* and */ pair of symbols denote C-style multi-line comment.

Everything in between is ignored by the compiler.

``` C++
/* This is a multiline comment, everything in between the two symbols is ignored.
```

Multi-line comments can be nested

``` C++
/* This is a multi-line /* comment */ this is not inside the comment */ 
// The above comment ends at the first */, not the second */
```

### Good vs bad comments

Bad comment:

``` C++
// Set sight range to 0
sight = 0;
```

Good comment:

```C++
// The player just drank a potion of blindness and can not see anything
sight = 0;
```

Bad comment:

``` C++
// Calculate the cost of the items
cost = quantity * 2 * storePrice;
```

Good comment:

```C++
// We need to multiply quantity by 2 here because they are bought in pairs
cost = quantity * 2 * storePrice;
```
