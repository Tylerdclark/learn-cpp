# 1.5 â€” Introduction to iostream: cout, cin, and endl

The **input/output library** (io library) is part of the C++ standard library that deals with basic input and output.

The iostream library contains some useful variables to use in programs for input/output, like getting keyboard input and outputting to the screen.

To use the library, we need to include the iostream header at the top of the file, like:

``` c++
#include <iostream>
```

**std::cout** allows us to output to the terminal by using the **insertion operator (<<)** 

It can print:

* text
* numbers
* variables

To print multiple things, << can be chained, effectively concatenating them. 

``` c++
#include <iostream> // for std::cout

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Don't" << " forget" << " the" << " spaces";
    return 0;
}
```

Another way to do a pseudo-template string:

``` c++
#include <iostream> // for std::cout

int main()
{
    int num{}; // direct brace initialize to zero
    num << std:cin;
    std::cout << "Your number: " << num;
    return 0;
}
```

inserting **std::endl** into std::cout is one way to create a new line, like the '\n' character. Unlike the '\n' character, std::endl also flushes the output. Overall, '\n' is preferred, as it is more efficient.
